We present software (\url{https://github.com/andern/lpped})
for the classroom presentation of the simplex method in linear programming.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}
Linear Programming (LP) is the subfield of mathematical optimization where
the aim is to maximize a linear function under linear constraints. Such a problem
is called an LP problem. The simplex method is a family of algorithms for solving LP problems. 
Although there exist other algorithms for solving LP problems,
the simplex method is by far the one that is most used in practice.
It is also listed it as one of the top 10 algorithms of the twentieth century in
\cite{CiSaE2000}. Given the many applications of LP in economics and engineering and
management, it is deemed important to teach the simplex method to a wide range of
students. This range certainly includes students in applied mathematics and informatics,
but extends considerably beyond these groups. The fact that the simplex method is
taught to students with a weaker background in mathematics and algorithmics than
the abovementioned two groups should have important consequences for the way
in which we teach the simplex method.

In most courses on linear programming the need arises for demonstrating the simplex method step-by-step 
\emph{without being distracted by detailed calculations in elementary linear algebra}. Let us start by
introducing the simplex method by a simple example:
%and at the same time present some teaching issues at hand. 
\[
    \begin{array}{llcrcrcrcrcrcr}
    \text{Maximize}  &    x &+&    y \\
    \text{subject to}&  2 x &+&    y &\leq&   6\\
    \text{and}&         7 x &+& 13 y &\leq&  40\\
    \text{and}       &    x &,&    y &\geq&0    &
    \end{array}
\]
where the variables $x$ and $y$ range over the real numbers.
A first observation is that there exist feasible solutions,
since the polygon given by the four (yes, four!) inequalities contains,
for example, the origin. A first systematic step is to give these inequalities
all the same format $\mathit{variable}\geq 0$. For this purpose we introduce
two new variables, $u$ and $v$, measuring to what extent the first
two inequalities are satisfied. These new variables are commonly called
\emph{slack variables}. At the same time we introduce an extra variable
for the function $x+y$, the so-called \emph{objective function},
or \emph{objective} for short. Thus our LP problem is brought in
\emph{standard form}:
\[    
    \begin{array}{lcrcrcrcr}
      \zeta&=&   & &     x &+&     y & &  \\\hline
      u    &=& 6 &-&   2 x &-&     y & &  \\
      v    &=& 40&-&   7 x &-&  13 y & &  \\
      x,y,u,v  &\geq&0     & &  & &  & &    
    \end{array}
\]
Note that each edge of the polygon corresponds to a variable
being zero on that edge. Consequently,
vertices of the polygon are all given by a pair of
two distinct variables being zero. On the other hand, some of these
pairs take their values zero outside the polygon, f.e.\ , $x=v=0$.
Since the inequalities $x,y,u,v \geq 0$ are part of the standard, 
they are often omitted. The standard form is also called \emph{dictionary}.

Geometric considerations lead to the observation that the
maximal value of the objective under the constraints (linear
equalities and inequalities of the form 
$\mathit{variable}\geq 0$ is attained in a vertex of the
polygon. The idea of the standard form is
that the variables on the right (the \emph{basic} variables) are zero,
giving the variables on the left feasible, that is non-negative, values.

In the example, we start in the origin $x=y=0$ and get
value 0 for the objective $\zeta = x + y$.
Clearly, there is room for improving here, since actually 
the value 0 is the \emph{minimal} value of the objective
under the given constraints. How can one improve on this
value? The answer is: increase $x$ or $y$ or both.
In the simplex method one chooses one basic variable and
tries to increase it as much as possible, while keeping the
other basic variables constant zero.
Let's try to increase $x$ keeping $y=0$. How much can $x$ increase?
We see that $0 \leq u = 6 -2x-y$ allows us to increase $x$ to $3$
and that the other linear equality allows even more. Since both
$u\geq 0$ and $v\geq 0$ must be respected, we increase $x$ to $3$,
thereby getting $u=0$ as a consequence. Moreover the objective $x+y$ becomes 3.

Increased to $3$, $x$ doesn't qualify as a basic variable anymore.
Fortunately, the variable $u$ has become zero. Interchanging the roles of
$x$ and $u$ as basic and non-basic variable, respectively, restores 
the invariant of the standard form. The first equation $u = 6 -2x-y$ makes it
possible to express $x$ in $u,y$ such that $x$ can be eliminated from the
right-hand side of the standard form. Technically this is done by standard
row operations in linear algebra. The new dictionary becomes:
\[    
    \begin{array}{lcrcrcrcr}
      \zeta&=& 3 &-& 0.5 u &+& 0.5 y & &  \\\hline
      x    &=& 3 &-& 0.5 u &-& 0.5 y & &  \\
      v    &=& 19&+& 3.5 u &-& 9.5 y & &  \\

    \end{array}
\]
This still looks good, due to the simplicity of the example.
However, in the next step things are getting worse. The next step
starts by the observation that the objective would improve if we 
increase $y$ while keeping $u$ constant zero. We see that
$0\leq v = 19 + 3.5u - 9.5y$ allows us to increase $y$ to $2$
and that the other linear equality allows even more.
Hence we swap $y$ and $v$ and get,
again by standard row operations, the new dictionary:
\[    
    \begin{array}{lcrcrcrcr}
      \zeta&=& 4 &-& \frac{6}{19} u &-& \frac{1}{19} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\\hline
      x    &=& 2 &-&\frac{13}{19} u &+& \frac{1}{19} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\
      y    &=& 2 &+& \frac{7}{19} u &-& \frac{1}{19} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\
    \end{array}
\]
Observe that all dictionaries obtained under way are equivalent,
as the row operations could be reversed. Obtaining the last dictionary
would be a rather painful (but useful) exercise on the blackboard.
The good news is that we have found the maximum, as the coefficients of
both (now) basic variables $u$ and $v$ are negative. The maximum value $4$
of the objective is attained in the point $x=y=2$. These values are clearly
integers by the design of the example, and could also be obtained in a geometric
way (see the next section).

The bad news is that the last dictionary contains a mistake: the
last occurrence of $\frac{1}{19}$ should have been $\frac{2}{19}$.
The mistake may have gone unnoticed, since it doesn't spoil the answer.
However, the mistake may have confused the interested student who tries
to understand the details. Worse still, another interested student
may have asked the question: Can't we start with $y$ instead of $x$?
Oops, the example has not been designed to start with $y$, 
but of course this very good question deserves a detailed answer
and the lecturer starts boldly calculating on the blackboard.
Clearly, $0\leq v = 40 - 7x -13y$ allows us to increase $y$ to $\frac{40}{13}$
and that the other linear equality allows even more. Hence we swap $y$ and $v$ and get,
again by standard row operations, the new dictionary:
\[    
    \begin{array}{lcrcrcrcr}
      \zeta&=& \frac{40}{13} &+& \frac{6}{13} x &-& \frac{1}{13} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\\hline
      u    &=& \frac{38}{13} &-&\frac{19}{13} x &+& \frac{1}{13} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\
      y    &=& \frac{40}{13} &-& \frac{7}{13} x &-& \frac{1}{13} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\
    \end{array}
\]
At this point the lecturer almost regrets his willingness to answer the student's
question in detail, but manages as by miracle to finally produce the following dictionary
\[    
    \begin{array}{lcrcrcrcr}
      \zeta&=& 4 &-& \frac{6}{19} u &-& \frac{1}{19} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\\hline
      x    &=& 2 &-&\frac{13}{19} u &+& \frac{1}{19} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\
      y    &=& 2 &+& \frac{7}{19} u &-& \frac{2}{19} v &\vphantom{\frac{|}{|}} &  \\
    \end{array}
\]
Our hero (the lecturer) is pointed to the fraction $\frac{2}{19}$ by one of the students, 
but he soon discovers the mistake in the earlier calculation of this optimal dictionary. 
Happy End.
