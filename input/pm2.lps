\\ At a certain refinery, the refining process requires the production of at
\\ least two gallons of gasoline for each gallon of fuel oil. To meet the
\\ anticipated demands of winter, at least three million gallons of fuel oil a
\\ day will need to be produced. The demand for gasoline, on the other hand, is
\\ not more than 6.4 million gallons a day.
\\
\\ If gasoline is selling for $1.90 per gallon and fuel oil sells for
\\ $1.50/gal, how much of each should be produced in order to maximize revenue?
