\\ A calculator company produces a scientific calculator and a graphing
\\ calculator. Long-term projections indicate an expected demand of at least
\\ 100 scientific and 80 graphing calculators each day. Because of limitations
\\ on production capacity, no more than 200 scientific and 170 graphing
\\ calculators can be made daily. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at
\\ least 200 calculators much be shipped each day.
\\
\\ If each scientific calculator sold results in a $2 loss, but each graphing
\\ calculator produces a $5 profit, how many of each type should be made daily
\\ to maximize net profits?
