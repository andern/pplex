\\ In order to ensure optimal health (and thus accurate test results), a lab
\\ technician needs to feed the rabbits a daily diet containing a minimum of 24
\\ grams (g) of fat, 36 g of carbohydrates, and 4 g of protien. But the rabbits
\\ should be fed no more than five ounces of food a day.
\\
\\ Rather than order rabbit food that is custom-blended, it is cheaper to order
\\ Food X and Food Y, and blend them for an optimal mix. Food X contains 8 g of
\\ fat, 12 g of carbohydrates, and 2 g of protein per ounce, and costs $0.20
\\ per ounce. Food Y contains 12 g of fat, 12 g of carbohydrates, and 1 g of
\\ protein per ounce, at a cost of $0.30 per ounce.
\\
\\ What is the optimal blend?
min 1/5 x + 3/10 y
s.t   8 x +   12 y >= 24
     12 x +   12 y >= 36
      2 x +    1 y >= 4
        x +      y <= 5
