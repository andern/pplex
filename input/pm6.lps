\\ You have $12,000 to invest, and three different funds from which to choose.
\\ The municipal bond fund has a 7% return, the local bank's CDs have an 8%
\\ return, and the high-risk account has an expected (hoped-for) 12% return.
\\ To minimize risk, you decide not to invest any more than $2,000 in the
\\ high-risk account. For tax reasons, you need to invest at least three times
\\ as much in the municipal bonds as in the bank CDs. Assuming the year-end
\\ yields are as expected, what are the optimal investment amounts?
max       - 1/20 x - 1/25 y \\ Should have + 36/25
s.t              x +      y >= 10
                 x +      y <= 12
          -  1/3 x +      y <= 0
