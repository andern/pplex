Thu Nov 22, 2012 - 0.4.1
==========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a small error where horizontal lines could be drawn wrong (or
           not drawn at all).
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where the axes would not be drawn green if they were
           degenerate.
* MISC: The implementation of the coordinate system has been created
        as a separate library, jcoolib, making its development
        independent of pplex' development. This has resulted in
        some minor visual changes in pplex, e.g. a grid.
* MISC: ProGuard is now used to shrink pplex' jar files significantly.
        

Mon Oct 15, 2012 - 0.4.0
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: It is now possible to save the image of the feasible region
               at a resolution of your choice as a PNG file.
* NEW FEATURE: The font size in the left console can now be changed.
* MISC: A pplex applet. It can be compiled with 'ant applet'.
* MISC: Lines representing slack variables that are degenerate in
        the incumbent primal dictionary are now colored green.
* MISC: The gradient effect on unbounded feasible regions
        should now look even better.
* MISC: Lots of new example files, and some have been renamed to more
        descriptive names.


Wed Sep 12, 2012 - 0.3.2
==========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused resizing the window to zero
           heigth/width to produce an error.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in the pivoting algorithm that caused it
           to fail when all values on the right hand side
           were 0.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused the unit lines in the first
           quadrant not to be drawn.
* MISC: Variables can have names with underscores now.

Mon Aug 27, 2012 - 0.3.1
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: The center of the coordinate system is automatically
               set to the center of the feasible region.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused files with empty lines to become
           unreadable by pplex.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused files with objective coefficients
           implicitly stated to be zero to be unreadable by pplex.
* BUG FIX: pplex is no longer running in the background after it
           is closed by clicking the x. (Thanks to takoi).
* MISC: The 'update' function has been renamed to 'reinstate'.
* MISC: The gradient effect on unbounded feasible regions
        should now look a bit better.

Mon Aug 20, 2012 - 0.3.0
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: Infinite precision (not visualization part).
               No more rounding errors.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused `pivot` to return
           invertible matrices in some rare cases.

Tue Jul 31, 2012 - 0.2.0
===========================
* NEW FEATURE: A graphical interface for pplex that
               can visualize a linear program in two
               dimensions.
* MISC: The terminology in the help menu has been
        greatly improved.
* MISC: Changed name from lpped to pplex.

Mon Apr 23, 2012 - 0.1.1
===========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused `show optimality`
           to always report an optimal program
* MISC: Cleaned up the source code a bit.

Fri Apr 13, 2012 - 0.1.0
===========================
Initial release.
