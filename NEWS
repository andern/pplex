Wed Sep 12, 2012 - 0.3.2
==========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused resizing the window to zero
           heigth/width to produce an error.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in the pivoting algorithm that caused it
           to fail when all values on the right hand side
           were 0.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused the unit lines in the first
           quadrant not to be drawn.
* MISC: Variables can have names with underscores now.

Mon Aug 27, 2012 - 0.3.1
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: The center of the coordinate system is automatically
               set to the center of the feasible region.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused files with empty lines to become
           unreadable by pplex.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused files with objective coefficients
           implicitly stated to be zero to be unreadable by pplex.
* BUG FIX: pplex is no longer running in the background after it
           is closed by clicking the x. (Thanks to takoi).
* MISC: The 'update' function has been renamed to 'reinstate'.
* MISC: The gradient effect on unbounded feasible regions
        should now look a bit better.

Mon Aug 20, 2012 - 0.3.0
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: Infinite precision (not visualization part).
               No more rounding errors.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused `pivot` to return
           invertible matrices in some rare cases.

Tue Jul 31, 2012 - 0.2.0

               can visualize a linear program in two
               dimensions.
* MISC: The terminology in the help menu has been
        greatly improved.
* MISC: Changed name from lpped to pplex.

Mon Apr 23, 2012 - 0.1.1
