Sun Nov 09, 2014 - 0.5.2
==========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in the pivot command that caused some pivots on the dual
           dictionary to be falsely reported as invalid.
* BUG FIX: The format command now sets the output format correctly.
* MISC: Updated jcoolib to version 0.1.2 in order to fix a bug that caused
        some lines not to be drawn correctly.

Fri Aug 15, 2014 - 0.5.1
==========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that that caused the feasible region to sometimes not be
           shown correctly.
* MISC: Updated jcoolib to version 0.1.1 in order to fix a bug that caused
        some lines not to be drawn correctly.

Sun Jan 19, 2014 - 0.5.0
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: Numbers can now be output as fractions. Input files can also
               contain fractions on the format 'integer/integer'.
* NEW FEATURE: Added a 'format' command that lets the user change the output
               format of numbers.
* NEW FEATURE: A leaving variable for the 'pivot' command is now optional.
               Without a leaving variable, pplex will automatically calculate
               the optimal leaving variable for the specified entering variable
               according to the largest coefficient rule.
* MISC: The shell is completely rewritten, and has been created as a separate
        library, lightshell, making its development independent of pplex'
        development. This has resulted in some changes in the look and feel
        of the shell.
* MISC: The 'replace' and 'reinstate' commands have been renamed to 'phase1'
        and 'phase2', respectively. They both have the old command names as
        aliases for legacy use.

Thu Nov 22, 2012 - 0.4.1
==========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a small error where horizontal lines could be drawn wrong (or
           not drawn at all).
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where the axes would not be drawn green if they were
           degenerate.
* MISC: The implementation of the coordinate system has been created
        as a separate library, jcoolib, making its development
        independent of pplex' development. This has resulted in
        some minor visual changes in pplex, e.g. a grid.
* MISC: ProGuard is now used to shrink pplex' jar files significantly.

Mon Oct 15, 2012 - 0.4.0
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: It is now possible to save the image of the feasible region
               at a resolution of your choice as a PNG file.
* NEW FEATURE: The font size in the left console can now be changed.
* MISC: A pplex applet. It can be compiled with 'ant applet'.
* MISC: Lines representing slack variables that are degenerate in
        the incumbent primal dictionary are now colored green.
* MISC: The gradient effect on unbounded feasible regions
        should now look even better.
* MISC: Lots of new example files, and some have been renamed to more
        descriptive names.


Wed Sep 12, 2012 - 0.3.2
==========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused resizing the window to zero
           heigth/width to produce an error.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in the pivoting algorithm that caused it
           to fail when all values on the right hand side
           were 0.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused the unit lines in the first
           quadrant not to be drawn.
* MISC: Variables can have names with underscores now.

Mon Aug 27, 2012 - 0.3.1
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: The center of the coordinate system is automatically
               set to the center of the feasible region.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused files with empty lines to become
           unreadable by pplex.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused files with objective coefficients
           implicitly stated to be zero to be unreadable by pplex.
* BUG FIX: pplex is no longer running in the background after it
           is closed by clicking the x. (Thanks to takoi).
* MISC: The 'update' function has been renamed to 'reinstate'.
* MISC: The gradient effect on unbounded feasible regions
        should now look a bit better.

Mon Aug 20, 2012 - 0.3.0
==========================
* NEW FEATURE: Infinite precision (not visualization part).
               No more rounding errors.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused `pivot` to return
           invertible matrices in some rare cases.

Tue Jul 31, 2012 - 0.2.0
===========================
* NEW FEATURE: A graphical interface for pplex that
               can visualize a linear program in two
               dimensions.
* MISC: The terminology in the help menu has been
        greatly improved.
* MISC: Changed name from lpped to pplex.

Mon Apr 23, 2012 - 0.1.1
===========================
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug that caused `show optimality`
           to always report an optimal program
* MISC: Cleaned up the source code a bit.

Fri Apr 13, 2012 - 0.1.0
===========================
Initial release.
