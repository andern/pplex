3.0) Installing pplex
---- ----------------
If you want to try pplex before installing it, you can try it as an applet by
visiting http://pplex.ii.uib.no. It has most of the functionality
of pplex (but you cannot read your own files.)

Running pplex requires Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer.

A quick way to get started:
1. git clone https://github.com/andern/pplex.git
2. cd pplex
3. java -jar pplex.jar

Or... download the latest stable jar file from here:
https://github.com/andern/pplex/blob/master/pplex.jar?raw=true

3.1) Running pplex
---- -------------
pplex starts in visual mode by default. This is only relevant for linear
programs with two variables. pplex can easily be run without a graphical
interface in a terminal window by passing the '-nogui' argument like this:
  `java -jar pplex.jar -nogui`



4.0) Compiling pplex
---- ---------------
Run the following commands:
1. git clone https://github.com/andern/pplex.git
2. cd pplex
3. ant ('ant mac' if you are on Mac OS X)

Compiling pplex requires:
* Java Development Kit
* Apache Ant

Details about the steps above:
1. To clone the repository, you need git installed on your system.
   Alternatively, you can download the repository as an archive file
   on the project web page.
2. Enter the newly downloaded directory.
3. Compile the sources of pplex and build a jar that is runnable on
   several platforms.

Type 'ant -p' for information about several build targets for pplex.


4.1) Applet
---- ------
pplex can be compiled as an applet by running
  `ant applet`
in the pplex directory.

on how to deploy the applet on your own website.
