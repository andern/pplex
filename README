2.1) Reporting Bugs

GitHub's issue tracker is used for tracking bugs of pplex. Before submitting a

that the bug has not already been submitted to the tracker on GitHub.



3.0) Installing pplex
---- ----------------
If you want to try pplex before installing it, you can try it as an applet by
visiting http://pplex.ii.uib.no. It has most of the functionality
of pplex (but you cannot read your own files.)

Running pplex requires Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer.

1. Download the newest version of pplex from
   http://folk.uib.no/xif001/pplex/pplex.jar and put it anywhere you like.
2. Double-click on pplex.jar.


(Optional) Getting started:
3. Download test.lps from http://folk.uib.no/xif001/pplex/test.lps and
   put it in the same directory as pplex.jar.
4. Type 'read test.lps' in pplex' console.


3.1) Running pplex
---- -------------
pplex starts in visual mode by default. This is only relevant for linear
programs with two variables. pplex can easily be run without a graphical
interface in a terminal window by passing the '-nogui' argument like this:
  `java -jar pplex.jar -nogui`



4.0) Compiling pplex
---- ---------------
Compiling pplex requires:
* Java Development Kit
* Apache Ant

To compile pplex you first need to download the source code of pplex. This
can be done from the website (see 2.0) or by cloning the repository.

To clone the repository you need git installed on your system. Cloning
the repository is done by typing the following in a terminal:
  `git clone git@github.com:andern/pplex.git`

To only compile the sources of pplex, run
  `ant compile`
in the pplex directory.

To compile the sources of pplex and build a runnable jar, run
  `ant jar`
  or simply
  `ant`


4.1) Applet
---- ------
pplex can be compiled as an applet by running
  `ant applet`
in the pplex directory.

See applet.html in the pplex directory for an example
on how to deploy the applet on your own website.
