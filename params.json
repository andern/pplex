{"name":"pplex","tagline":"a pedagogical implementation of the Simplex method","body":"# About\r\npplex is an application that can interpret linear programs (LP) and show\r\nhow the LP dictionary evolves throughout the execution of the simplex method.\r\n\r\npplex is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\npplex uses Apache Commons Math library for handling matrices.

See lib/LICENSE.TXT for more information.\r\n\r\n![pplex supports visualization](https://raw.github.com/andern/pplex/master/doc/teaching_simplex/ex_gui3.png)\r\n\r\n[Try the pplex applet!](http://pplex.ii.uib.no)\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\nDocumentation on how to use pplex can be found [here](https://raw.github.com/andern/pplex/master/doc/pplex_intro.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Reporting Bugs\r\nGitHub's issue tracker is used for tracking bugs of pplex. Before submitting a\r\nbug you should make sure that you are running the latest version of pplex, and\r\nthat the bug has not already been submitted to the tracker on GitHub.\r\n\r\n# Installing pplex\r\nIf you want to try pplex before installing it, you can try it as an applet by\r\nvisiting http://pplex.ii.uib.no. It has most of the functionality\r\nof pplex (but you cannot read your own files.)\r\n\r\nRunning pplex requires Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer.\r\n\r\n1. Download the newest version of pplex from one of the links above.\r\n2. Extract the archive.\r\n3. Double-click on pplex.jar.\r\n4. (Getting started) Type read input/vdb2.8.lps in pplex' console.\r\n\r\n## Running pplex\r\npplex starts in visual mode by default. This is only relevant for linear\r\nprograms with two variables. pplex can easily be run without a graphical\r\ninterface in a terminal window by passing the '-nogui' argument like this:\r\n  `java -jar pplex.jar -nogui`\r\n\r\n# Compiling pplex\r\nCompiling pplex requires:\r\n* Java Development Kit\r\n* Apache Ant\r\n\r\nTo compile pplex you first need to download the source code of pplex. This\r\ncan be done from the website or by cloning the repository.\r\n\r\nTo clone the repository you need git installed on your system. Cloning\r\nthe repository is done by typing the following in a terminal:\r\n  `git clone git@github.com:andern/pplex.git`\r\n\r\nTo only compile the sources of pplex, run\r\n  `ant compile`\r\nin the pplex directory.\r\n\r\nTo compile the sources of pplex and build a runnable jar, run\r\n  `ant jar`\r\n  or simply\r\n  `ant`\r\n\r\n## Applet\r\npplex can be compiled as an applet by running\r\n  `ant applet`\r\nin the pplex directory.\r\n\r\nSee applet.html in the pplex directory for an example\r\non how to deploy the applet on your own website.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
